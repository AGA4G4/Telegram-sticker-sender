# Telegram-sticker-sender
This is a n8n server based on docker which sends a sticker, announcing the weekday and the date of the day into your channel
Me myself put everything in a folder, seperating the yml file from everything for better organization; I suggest you to do the same
For the workflow in the n8n, after building your docker file and getting it up, you can import the .json file I put here or you can arrange it the way you want.
I removed the bot token for security measures and for this thing to work, you have to put your telegram bot token in the yml file.
